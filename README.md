# net-telent-date

**Description:**

*net-telent-date* is a date and time parsing and formatting library
originally written by Jim Healy for
[CMUCL](http://www.cons.org/cmucl/). It was later packaged and
maintained under its current name by Daniel Barlow and Kevin Rosenberg.

It contains routines for printing and parsing
[RFC822](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt), RFC2822 and HTTP time
strings primarily, but can be used to parse other time formats as well.

In this repository bugs related to parsing time zones were fixed, a big
table of recognized time zone identifiers was added and the code base was
tidied up. The current version is
[0.43](https://github.com/eugeneia/net-telent-date/releases/tag/0.43).
